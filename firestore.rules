/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TempoWise application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model where each user can only
 * access their own data. All data is nested under the /users/{userId} path.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /users/{userId}/activities/{activityId}: Stores time tracking activities.
 * - /users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}: Stores user-defined categories.
 * - /users/{userId}/tags/{tagId}: Stores user-defined tags.
 * - /users/{userId}/weeklyGoals/{weeklyGoalId}: Stores user's weekly goals.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyEnergyLevels/{dailyEnergyLevelId}: Stores daily energy level entries.
 * - /users/{userId}/notes/{noteId}: Stores user's notes.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access data under their own user ID.
 * - Data consistency between the path and the document's internal fields are enforced.
 * - List operations are restricted to the owner of the data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The userId is present in the path itself, enforcing ownership without needing to read the document data.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - All user-specific data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, ensuring a consistent security posture.
